# Frontend Mentor Challenges

## Description
Every challenge is to build different kind of web page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to complete the challenge.

These are my solutions about [Frontend Mentor Challenges] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).

In my solutions I used HTML 5, CSS 3, and if it's necessary JavaScript.
